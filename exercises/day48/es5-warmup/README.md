# ES5 Warmup

In this activity we will examine a JavaScript file and determine the values printed by each log function.

## Instructions

* Open [var-example.js](Unsolved/var-example.js) and discuss the code with a partner without actually running it.

* Replace each "?" in the comments with the value you expect to be printed by each log function. 

* For each example, discuss your reasoning with your partner.

### Bonus

* After successfully completing the base activity, see if you can convert the example to use `const` and `let` identifiers instead of `var`.

  * This is jumping a bit ahead to material we'll go over next, but check out [Wes Bos's simple const & let introduction](http://wesbos.com/let-vs-const/) for help with this.
